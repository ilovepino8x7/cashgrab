# Cash Grab

## Description
Cash Grab is a (very) basic tower defense game where you place down towers with different abilities, from shooting old Qing Dynasty style coins at extreme pace to defeat the enemies, to freezing them still to stop their advance.
### Works on phone, but ideally would be played on a device with a mouse or trackpad.
